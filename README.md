# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the Requirement Analysis Project, which simulates a real-world software development process by capturing, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a booking management system. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate industry-standard practices in documenting functional and non-functional requirements, creating visual diagrams, and defining acceptance criteria.

By working through these tasks, we aim to establish a clear and well-organized blueprint for the software, ensuring that all project requirements are thoroughly understood and documented before the development phase begins. This foundation will help enhance clarity, scalability, and alignment with business and user goals, laying the groundwork for a successful software project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of all stakeholders for a software system. It forms the very foundation of any successful software project. The goal is to ensure that everyone involved — clients, end-users, business analysts, and developers — shares a clear and accurate understanding of what the system must do before design and implementation begin.

Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical early stages of the Software Development Lifecycle. Its outcomes drive all the subsequent phases — design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Its key contributions include:

Defining Project Scope:
Clearly stated requirements help set the boundaries of the project. This prevents scope creep — the uncontrolled growth of project requirements — and keeps the project focused.

Aligning Stakeholder Expectations:
By thoroughly capturing and agreeing on requirements up front, all stakeholders, including customers, product managers, and the engineering team, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals. This prevents costly misunderstandings later.

Improving Design and Development:
When requirements are well-structured and unambiguous, they help architects and developers create software that precisely matches the intended purpose. This reduces the need for expensive rework or last-minute fixes.

Supporting Accurate Estimates:
Well-documented requirements enable teams to estimate the time, effort, and resources more realistically. This is vital for planning schedules, allocating resources, and setting realistic deadlines.

Ensuring Quality and User Satisfaction:
Detailed requirements help testers create thorough test cases. When the software is eventually tested against its acceptance criteria, it’s easier to verify that the product meets the users’ needs — resulting in higher satisfaction.

Conclusion
In short, Requirement Analysis is a core pillar of SDLC because it lays the groundwork for all further phases. Getting this stage right not only improves efficiency and predictability during the project but also significantly increases the likelihood of delivering a robust, high-quality product that meets or exceeds expectations. Without proper Requirement Analysis, projects often face misaligned objectives, delays, and cost overruns — all of which can be avoided by investing time and attention at the very beginning.
