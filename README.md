# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the Requirement Analysis Project, which simulates a real-world software development process by capturing, analyzing, and structuring requirements for a booking management system. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate industry-standard practices in documenting functional and non-functional requirements, creating visual diagrams, and defining acceptance criteria.

By working through these tasks, we aim to establish a clear and well-organized blueprint for the software, ensuring that all project requirements are thoroughly understood and documented before the development phase begins. This foundation will help enhance clarity, scalability, and alignment with business and user goals, laying the groundwork for a successful software project.
